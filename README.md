# Adblock For Twitch

Adblock For Twitch blocks ads on Twitch by switching to an ad-free version of the stream at 480p during the ad-time and automatically switches back to the original video quality after the ad-time is over. This is 100% done locally, no proxies/VPNs or 3rd party scripts/websites are being used. This extension does not collect/share any of your personal information and the code is public.

You can find the extension on both Chrome and Firefox add-on stores.
